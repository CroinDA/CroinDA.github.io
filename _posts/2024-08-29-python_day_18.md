## 문제
A pyramid of blocks is constructed by first building a base layer of n blocks and then adding n-1 blocks to the next layer. This process is repeated until the top layer only has one block.

You must calculate the number of blocks needed to construct a pyramid given the size of the base. For example, a pyramid that has a base of size 4 will need a total of 10 blocks.

## 입력
The input will be a sequence of integers, one per line. The end of input will be signaled by the integer 0, and does not represent the base of a pyramid. All integers, other than the last (zero), are positive.

## 출력
For each positive integer print the total number of blocks needed to build the pyramid with the specified base.

## 풀이
- 1부터 입력받은 $n$까지의 합을 구하는 문제
- 0을 입력하면 `break`하는 무한반복문 `while True:` 활용

## 코드
```
while True:
    n = int(input())
    k = 0
    if n != 0:
        for i in range(n+1):
           k += i
        print(k)
    else:
        break
```
